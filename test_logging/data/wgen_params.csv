# WGEN Monthly Parameter Template
# This file contains monthly precipitation parameters for the WGEN weather generator
#
# NEW INTERFACE STRUCTURE:
# - Monthly precipitation parameters: PWW, PWD, ALPHA, BETA (12 values each, one per month)
# - Constant temperature/radiation parameters: Specified in YAML configuration
# - Latitude: Specified in YAML configuration for Fourier-based seasonal calculations
#
# IMPORTANT UNIT CONVERSIONS:
# - BETA values MUST be in millimeters (mm), NOT inches
# - If converting from legacy US data: beta_mm = beta_inches × 25.4
# - Temperature parameters in YAML should be in Celsius (°C)
# - Solar radiation should be in MJ/m²/day
#
# PARAMETER DESCRIPTIONS:
# - Month: Month number (1-12)
# - PWW: Probability of wet day following a wet day [0-1]
# - PWD: Probability of wet day following a dry day [0-1]
# - ALPHA: Gamma distribution shape parameter (dimensionless, > 0)
# - BETA: Gamma distribution scale parameter (mm, > 0)
#
# VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
# ✓ BETA values are 3-25 mm for typical climates (not 0.2-1.0 which indicates unconverted inches)
# ✓ Mean precipitation per wet day (ALPHA × BETA) is 3-20 mm for most climates
# ✓ Probabilities (PWW, PWD) are between 0 and 1
# ✓ File has exactly 12 rows (one per month)
#
# EXAMPLE VALUES BELOW:
# These parameters represent a temperate climate station (latitude ~40°N)
# Mean annual precipitation: ~800 mm
# Values are already converted to SI units (mm)
